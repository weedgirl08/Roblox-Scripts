## ▶️ How To Run Scripts

Running Roblox scripts involves copying them into Roblox or running them through a script executor. Here’s a simple way to do this without deep computer knowledge:

- **Step 1:** Start Roblox and enter the game where you want to use a script.
- **Step 2:** Open the folder where you saved the scripts.
- **Step 3:** Select the script you want to use. Scripts usually have `.lua` as a file extension.
- **Step 4:** Use a Roblox script executor. This is a tool that runs scripts inside the game. Examples include Synapse X, Krnl, or others. (You might find online guides on how to get these).
- **Step 5:** Follow the executor instructions to open and run the script from your saved file.
- **Step 6:** Once the script runs, you should see changes or new features in your Roblox game.

Always be careful when downloading executors or scripts. Only use files you trust.
